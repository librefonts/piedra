  The world may seem cartoonish to you, pilgrim, but the funnies ain't really that funny.
The Flintstones are so last century.
The Hulks are in, and they're here to stay.
Piedra is the rocky, fear-inducing face of galvanized triceps and &Atilde;&frac14;berchiseled jawlines.
Be intimidated, be very intimidated.
You don't believe it?
